    Be able to explain what accounts for the processing time difference between the bubble-sort
    and the selection sort algorithms?

    The factor to consider with the difference between the processing time of bubble-sort and selection-sort
    is the method of both sorting algorithm. Bubble-sort exchanges elements while
    selection sorts selects. In terms of speed selection-sort is faster than bubble-sort.
